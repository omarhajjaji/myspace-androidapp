    <string name="jupiter_desc">1-THE GRANDEST PLANET\n
Eleven Earths could fit across Jupiter\'s equator. If Earth were the size of a grape,
Jupiter would be the size of a basketball.\n
2-FIFTH PLANET FROM OUR STAR\n
Jupiter orbits about 778 million kilometers\n
3-SHORT DAY/LONG YEAR\n
Jupiter rotates once about every 10 hours (a Jovian day),
but takes about 12 Earth years to complete one orbit of the Sun (a Jovian year).\n
4-MASSIVE WORLD, LIGHT ELEMENTS\n
Jupiter\'s atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen (H2) and helium (He).\n
5-WORLDS GALORE\n
Jupiter has more than 75 moons.</string>
    <string name="mercury_desc">1-SMALLEST\n
Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system—only slightly larger than Earth\'s Moon.\n
2-INSIDER\n
It is the closest planet to the Sun at a distance of about 36 million miles (58 million kilometers) or 0.39 AU.\n
3-LONG DAYS, SHORT YEARS\n
One day on Mercury (the time it takes for Mercury to rotate or spin once with respect to the stars) takes 59 Earth days. One day-night cycle on Mercury takes 175.97 Earth days. Mercury makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Mercury time) in just 88 Earth days.\n
4-ROUGH SURFACE\n
Mercury is a rocky planet, also known as a terrestrial planet. Mercury has a solid, cratered surface, much like the Earth\'s moon.\n
5-CAN\'T BREATHE IT\n
Mercury\'s thin atmosphere, or exosphere, is composed mostly of oxygen (O2), sodium (Na), hydrogen (H2), helium (He), and potassium (K). Atoms that are blasted off the surface by the solar wind and micrometeoroid impacts create Mercury\'s exosphere.</string>
    <string name="venus_desc">1-EARTH-SIZED\n
If the sun were as tall as a typical front door, the Earth and Venus would each be about the size of a nickel.\n
2-SECOND ROCK\n
Venus orbits our Sun, a star. Venus is the second closest planet to the sun at a distance of about 67 million miles (108 million km).\n
3-A DAY LONGER THAN A YEAR\n
One day on Venus lasts 243 Earth days because Venus spins backwards, with its sun rising in the west and setting in the east.\n
4-DIVERSE TERRAIN\n
Venus\' solid surface is a volcanic landscape covered with extensive plains featuring high volcanic mountains and vast ridged plateaus.\n
5-GREENHOUSE EFFECT\n
The planet\'s surface temperature is about 900 degrees Fahrenheit (465 degrees Celsius)—hot enough to melt lead.

    <string name="mars_desc">
        1-SMALL PLANET\n
If the Sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth would be the size of a dime, and Mars would be about as big as an aspirin tablet.\n
2-FOURTH ROCK\n
Mars orbits our Sun, a star. Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun at an average distance of about 228 million km (142 million miles) or 1.52 AU.\n
3-LONGER DAYS\n
One day on Mars takes a little over 24 hours. Mars makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Martian time) in 687 Earth days.\n
4-RUGGED TERRAIN\n
Mars is a rocky planet. Its solid surface has been altered by volcanoes, impacts, winds, crustal movement and chemical reactions.\n
5-BRING A SPACESUIT\n
Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide (CO2), argon (Ar), nitrogen (N2), and a small amount of oxygen and water vapor.
    </string>
    <string name="earth_desc">1.MEASURING UP\n
If the Sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth would be the size of a nickel.\n
2-THIRD ROCK\n
Earth orbits our Sun, a star. Earth is the third planet from the Sun at a distance of about 93 million miles (150 million km).\n
3-AS THE WORLD TURNS\n
A day on Earth is 24 hours. Earth makes a complete orbit around the sun (a year in Earth time) in about 365 days.\n
4-WE\'RE ON IT\n
Earth is a rocky planet with a solid and dynamic surface of mountains, canyons, plains and more. Most of our planet is covered in water.\n
5-BREATHE EASY\n
Earth\'s atmosphere is 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other ingredients—the perfect balance to breathe and live.\n
    </string>
    <string name="saturn_desc">
        1-A COLOSSAL PLANET\n
Nine Earths side by side would almost span Saturn’s diameter. That doesn’t include Saturn’s rings.\n
2-IN DIM LIGHT\n
Saturn is the sixth planet from our Sun (a star) and orbits at a distance of about 886 million miles (1.4 billion kilometers) from the Sun.\n
3-SHORT DAY, LONG YEAR\n
Saturn takes about 10.7 hours (no one knows precisely) to rotate on its axis once—a Saturn “day”—and 29 Earth years to orbit the sun.\n
4-GAS GIANT\n
Saturn is a gas-giant planet and therefore does not have a solid surface like Earth’s. But it might have a solid core somewhere in there.

    <string name="pluto_desc">
        1-SMALL WORLD\n
Pluto is about 1,400 miles (2,380 km) wide. That\'s about half the width of the United States, or 2/3 the width of Earth\'s moon.\n
2-DEEP SPACE\n
Pluto orbits the Sun about 3.6 billion miles (5.8 billion km) away on average, about 40 times as far as Earth, in a region called the Kuiper Belt.\n
3-SLOW JOURNEY\n
A year on Pluto is 248 Earth years. A day on Pluto lasts 153 hours, or about 6 Earth days.\n
4-SMALL IN SIZE, BUT NOT IN IMPORTANCE\n
Pluto is officially classified as a dwarf planet.\n
5-HAZY DAYS\n
Pluto has a thin atmosphere of nitrogen, methane and carbon monoxide. The atmosphere has a blue tint and distinct layers of haze.\n
6-MOON DANCE\n
Pluto has 5 moons. The largest, Charon, is so big that Pluto and Charon orbit each other like a double planet.
